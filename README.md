## Description

This is a survival FPS started by following the FPS class by Ben Tristam as part of the Unreal Engine course on Udemy. 
After, I will be adding on top of the established framework with my own ideas and concepts. 

`TODO Create a more in depth description of the game. `

## Setup

### Setup Requirements

In order to run this program you must have at least Unreal Engine 4 installed. Please note the code was written using Visual Studio 2015 so I'm not certain if there are any compatibility issues with Visual Studio 2013. 

`TODO Create a more detailed Setup Guide`

### Beginning with Testing Grounds

Clone or download the repository and run the BattleTanks.uproject file to have Unreal Engine create a project for you.
